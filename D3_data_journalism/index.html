          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>There appears to be a significant correlation in which the states with a higher percentage of their population
            in poverty also leads to a higher percentage of population that lacks healthcare, are smokers, and are also obese.
            This would lead one to assume that the states with the higher percentage of population living in poverty would have 
            a higher percentage of unhealthy people in general.
          </p>

          <p>There does not appear to be any significant correlation between the median age of a states population an the 
            percentage of the population that lacks healthcare or is obese. There does appear to be a slight correlation
            between the median age and the percentage of smokers. Median age may not be the best indicator to use in order 
            to determine the overall health of a population.
          </p>

          <p>There appears to be a significant correlation in which the states with a higher household median income have 
            significantly less of their percentage of population that lack healthcare, are smokers, and are obese. This could 
            lead one to assume that the states with the higher the median income of the population in a given state would have 
            a higher percentage of healthy people compared to states with a smaller household median income.</p>
