# D3-Challenge

The goal of this challenge was to use JavaScript and D3 coding to read in the data of a csv file containing demographic data for all 50 states and then then to dispay the information on an html website using a D3 chart. The chart needed to display the data in a comparitive way and also needed to include the state abbreviations as identifiers. 

Files included in this challenge: data.csv, app.js, app2.js, index.html, style.css, d3Style.css

Languages used: JavaScript, CSS, HTML

The app.js file contains the first part of the challenge comparing each states poverty percentage data to it's obesity percentage. Along with the state abbreviation for each data point, I included a mouseover and click function for each data point. The click function displays the state's toolTip data for each point on the chart. 

My main takeaway from this challenge is that using JavaScript and Plotly graphs are great tools for processing and presenting data in so that it can be displayed in a easy to read and understand format. I enjoyed learning and working with a variety of Plotly graphing and chart styles and it helped me to understand how and why different graphs would be used for different sets of data.

The bubble chart was my favorite chart to create as it was fun working with the different color palettes to see how to best display the data. I like that I was able to display the unique OTU ID below the x axis at the bottom of the bubble chart when cursor hovers over each specific bubble while displaying the OTU labels and values on the bubble.

The gauge was by far the hardest chart to create and took the most time to research as we did not cover this type of chart in class. I found a variety of guage chart options but very few included a pointer. I thought it was cool to be able to use a little trigonometry to calculate the pointer movements and I need to do some more independent research to fully understand the path information for the pointer shape.

I also added in some style.css code to update the display on the website including font on coloring to give the site some uniqueness and to be more eye catching.
